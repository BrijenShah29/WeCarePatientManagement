# WeCarePatientManagement Application

This application is based on cross-App platform react Native. 
This application focuses on managing patients in any medical Institute. This application uses react-native navigations, custom styles, CSS and Axios for CRUD operations. 
I have used MongoDB for backend and can be found in separate repository in my GitHub.
